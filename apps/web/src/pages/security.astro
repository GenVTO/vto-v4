      <h2>1. Our Commitment to Security</h2>
      <p>
        At {APP_CONFIG.name}, we are committed to protecting the data you share
        with us. This Security Policy outlines the measures we take to ensure
        the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your information.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Data Encryption</h2>
      <p>
        All data transmitted between your browser and our servers is encrypted
        using Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 or higher. Data at rest is
        encrypted using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Infrastructure Security</h2>
      <p>
        Our infrastructure is hosted on world-class cloud providers (Cloudflare,
        AWS) that maintain strict physical and logical security controls. We
        regularly update our systems to patch known vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Access Controls</h2>
      <p>
        Access to production data is strictly limited to authorized personnel
        who require it to perform their job duties. We use multi-factor
        authentication (MFA) for all administrative access.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Reporting Vulnerabilities</h2>
      <p>
        We welcome reports from security researchers. If you believe you have
        found a vulnerability in our service, please report it to
        security@genvto.com. We will investigate all reports and address valid
        vulnerabilities promptly.
